I was responsible for core engine features (openFrameworks/C++); 3D GUI framework, interactive video scrubbing, dynamic DOF Gaussian blur shaders, Lua integration, profiling and optimisation. <br/> I also led the development of GUI editor tool (Qt/C++), for use by film directors, editors and game designers to rapidly create branching interactive experiences. </p>
