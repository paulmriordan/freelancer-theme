description: <p align="left">  I collaborated with an artist to create 'Tidy Robots', a free-to-play mobile puzzle game. It was developed over a number of years, part-time, weekends and evenings. I was responsible for design, programming, music, and audio. It was awarded feature placement on the App Store, 100% positive reviews, and an average 4.7/5 user rating.
<br /> <br />
The game was made using the Unity engine, and features:
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Custom puzzle editor</li>
  <li>Data-driven JSON tutorial system</li>
  <li>Facebook SDK integration for custom leaderboards</li>
  <li>Kii MBaaS integration for remote configuration, saving users scores, pushing weekly puzzle updates without an app update</li>
  <li>OneSignal push notifications</li>
  <li>Ironsource mediation for banner, interstitial, and reward video adverts</li>
</ul>
<br />
We teamed up with [Umbrella Games](umbrella.games) as publisher, who provided assistance with final art polish, marketing, QA, localisation, and release support. </p>
