It was developed over a number of years, part-time, weekends and evenings. I was responsible for design, programming, music, and audio. <br/> <br/> It was awarded feature placement on the App Store, 100% positive reviews, and an average 4.7/5 user rating. <br/> <br/> We teamed up with as publisher, who provided assistance with final art polish, marketing, QA, localisation, and release support.</p>
