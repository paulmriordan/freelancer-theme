description: I collaborated with an artist to create 'Tidy Robots', a free-to-play mobile puzzle game. It was developed over a number of years, part-time, weekends and evenings. I was responsible for design, programming, music, and audio.

It was awarded feature placement on the App Store, 100% positive reviews, and an average 4.7/5 user rating.

The game was made using the Unity engine, and features:
- Custom puzzle editor
- Data-driven JSON tutorial system
- Facebook SDK integration for custom leaderboards
- Kii MBaaS integration for remote configuration, saving users scores, pushing weekly puzzle updates without an app update
- OneSignal push notifications
- Ironsource mediation for banner, interstitial, and reward video adverts

We teamed up with [Umbrella Games](umbrella.games) as publisher, who provided assistance with final art polish, marketing, QA, localisation, and release support.
