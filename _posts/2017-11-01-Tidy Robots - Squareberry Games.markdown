title: Tidy Robots - Squareberry Games
description: <p align="left"> I collaborated with an artist to create 'Tidy Robots', a free-to-play mobile puzzle game. It was developed over a number of years, part-time, weekends and evenings. I was responsible for design, programming, music, and audio. It was awarded feature placement on the App Store, 100% positive reviews, and an average 4.7/5 user rating. <br /> <br /> The game was made using the Unity engine, and features: <br /> <ul><li>Custom puzzle editor</li><li>Data-driven JSON tutorial system</li><li>Facebook SDK integration for custom leaderboards</li><li>Kii MBaaS integration for remote configuration, saving users scores, pushing weekly puzzle updates without an app update</li><li>OneSignal push notifications</li><li>Ironsource mediation for banner, interstitial, and reward video adverts</li></ul><br /> We teamed up with Umbrella Games as publisher, who provided assistance with final art polish, marketing, QA, localisation, and release support. </p>
