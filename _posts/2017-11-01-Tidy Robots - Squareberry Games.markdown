title: Tidy Robots - Squareberry Games
description: <p align="left"> I collaborated with an artist to create 'Tidy Robots', a free-to-play mobile puzzle game. It was developed over a number of years, part-time, weekends and evenings. I was responsible for design, programming, music, and audio. It was awarded feature placement on the App Store, 100% positive reviews, and an average 4.7/5 user rating. <br /> <br /> The game was made using the Unity engine, and features: <br /> - Custom puzzle editor <br /> - Data-driven JSON tutorial system <br /> - Facebook SDK integration for custom leaderboards <br /> - Kii MBaaS integration for remote configuration, saving users scores, pushing weekly puzzle updates without an app update <br /> - OneSignal push notifications <br /> - Ironsource mediation for banner, interstitial, and reward video adverts. <br /> We teamed up with Umbrella Games as publisher, who provided assistance with final art polish, marketing, QA, localisation, and release support. </p>
