Selected by Apple as 'App Store Best of 2014', and received over 25 million downloads. I worked on the majority of gameplay features, including the settlements house-clumping, and the 'land manipulation' feature. For the latter, I designed a custom algorithm for applying user deformations to a procedural terrain. Other responsibilities included gameplay features, user input, MapReduce multi-threaded spatial partitioning, and profiling & optimisation. <br/> <br/> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/godus/id815181808?mt=8"> <img border="0" alt="Godus ios" src="img/portfolio/apple_button.png"> </a> </p>
