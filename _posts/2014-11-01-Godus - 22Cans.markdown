description: <p align="left">  The 2nd project I worked on at 22cans. Selected by Apple as 'App Store Best of 2014', and received over 25 million downloads. I worked on the majority of gameplay features, including the settlements house-clumping, and the 'land manipulation' feature. For the latter, I designed a custom algorithm for applying user deformations to a procedural terrain. Other responsibilities included gameplay features, user input, MapReduce multi-threaded spatial partitioning, and profiling & optimisation. </p>
