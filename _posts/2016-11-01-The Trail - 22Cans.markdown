title: The Trail - 22cans
description: <p align="left"> The third project I worked on at 22cans. It was selected by Apple as one of the 'top 10 games of 2016', receiving over 20 millions downloads, and overwhelmingly positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I worked on the majority of gameplay features, including character and camera controls, 'trail item' interaction, remote terrain streaming, mini-games, and networked multiplayer towns. <br /> <br /> I also designed and implemented a system for merging character body part meshes and textures, successfully reducing memory load and GPU drawcalls. This allowed limitless character clothing variations, while maintaining performance when rendering multiple characters on mobile devices. <br /> <br /> I worked closely with designers, animators, and artists to create bespoke Unity Editor tools and asset pipelines, and mentored team members on Unity features and software development principles. </p>
